<h2>The City of Calderon</h2>
The city of Calderon was built along the banks of a muddy grey river and is truly a multicultural curiosity. Its spires reach out of the firm clay on which it is built, as it was easier to build up than it was to build down.
The buildings are made of brick, blending in with the clay of the ground. The river makes Calderon a hub of trade, and an epicenter of humanity (and other races).

The skyline is scattered with dilpidated brick walls and creeping vines, it is a city steeped in history. Education is poor in Calderon but culture is widespread and participating in the finer arts is an honored tradition. The city has a history of conquest, and is full of ghettos of previously ruling civilizations, all of which are inevitably later conquered without protest. What historically was a city of predictability has grown into a fusion of everything and it's this that unites the people to this day.

It's this multicultural identity that has truly left its mark. Hundreds of pubs, theme restaurants and take-outs offer a plethora of culinary choices and those who feel hungry for something else can enjoy art galleries, sightseeing, sports or one of the many other recreational venues.

<h3>The Heist</h3>
The year is 5087-OC. The city is covered in a dense fog, a common occurance in Calderon. The moonlight illuminates the west bank of the river as it seems to climb out of the water.  Our motely assortment, a Goblin, a Minotaur, a Dark Elf and a Human have been hired to perform an art heist, they sit in a pub within the theater district, their target, an art gallery two blocks away. Their task is to steal a painting known as the False Chanterelle.

The heist is planned. Nicodemus scouted out the area, knowing it to be a quiet district of town he expected it to not often be under watch. He discovered the the gallery was not a particularly famous one and as he staked it out he found that the gallery keeper, an elderly grey haired man, kept short hours. Robert Kirby, the group's tactician, discovered that the painting would be going out to sea, and the time window in which they would need to steal it.

And so the heist was launched! The ragtag group leaves their pub and makes their way across town, although a varied group they are not stopped on the way. They are able to break into the side entrance of the shop, Chizbint picking the lock without issue. Chizbint nicks a lockbox unknown to the rest of the party and then lets them in. They find the painting quickly, bundle it in a sleeping bag. Kevin, guarding the alley-way, makes some small talk with a local while they wait. They leave the shop, light their lantern, and make their way across the town to the wharf district. Their travel to the drop is uninterrupted save by a small hello from an acting friend of Nicodemus, whom is promised some catch up at The Broken Leg later that week. They get to the shack and hang the painting on the western wall as per the instructions of Nicodemus's contact. 

<h3>The Painting</h3>

While waiting for the fence to arrive, they meet with a local who regales them with tales of the town. They convince the local to walk off, just in time, for they hear calls for help coming from the shack. In the shack the group finds the painting has become animated. The group touches the painting and one by one gets sucked inside. After some minor arguing Chizbint free's Ashen, the woman trapped in the painting. As Kevin, the Minotaur goes to reach for her she bounds out of his grasp and through the painting, flipping it over and trapping the group inside.

The group plods carefully through the entrance of the maze, Chizbint unlocking doors along the way. They come to a stop before the lady Crucem Capilli who offers them gold in exchange for art from the maze, when asked about the maze she replys that she would not want to spoil the adventure that they have ahead of them.

They make their way into the room on the right, with stairs in an escherlike pattern, and after making their way to the bottom of the stairs decide to attempt to whip Chizbint across the room into the door at the top of the stairs. He collides face first into the door, slamming it open and altering the gravity of the room, he is knocked unconcious and the room is flipped causing the party to almost fly to the bottom of the room. They catch their footing with the help of Nicodemus and make their way through the door to help Chizbint. They enter a dark and wet cavern with a large and vicious looking being, cradling an eerie looking human sized china doll. He is singing what sounds like birdsong. He waves them out of the room, and sends them on their way to a chamber filled with teeth. Upon crossing the chamber, very carefully, they find a door at the opposite end... A door which leads to a large pool with floating furniture of bone, and a shark man with two mouths.

Thus ends session 1.
