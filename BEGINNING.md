<h2>The City of Calderon</h2>
The city of Calderon was built along the banks of a muddy grey river and is truly a multicultural curiosity. Its spires reach out of the firm clay on which it is built, as it was easier to build up than it was to build down.
The buildings are made of brick, blending in with the clay of the ground. The river makes Calderon a hub of trade, and an epicenter of humanity (and other races).

The skyline is scattered with dilpidated brick walls and creeping vines, it is a city steeped in history. Education is poor in Calderon but culture is widespread and participating in the finer arts is an honored tradition. The city has a history of conquest, and is full of ghettos of previously ruling civilizations, all of which are inevitably later conquered without protest. What historically was a city of predictability has grown into a fusion of everything and it's this that unites the people to this day.

It's this multicultural identity that has truly left its mark. Hundreds of pubs, theme restaurants and take-outs offer a plethora of culinary choices and those who feel hungry for something else can enjoy art galleries, sightseeing, sports or one of the many other recreational venues.

<h3>The Heist</h3>
The year is 5087OC. The city is covered in a dense fog, a common occurance in Calderon. The moonlight illuminates the west bank of the river as it seems to climb out of the water.  Our motely assortment, a Goblin, a Minotaur, a Dark Elf and a Human have been hired to perform an art heist, they sit in a pub within the theater district, their target, an art gallery two blocks away. Their task is to steal a painting known as the False Chanterelle.
